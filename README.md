# Sentimental-Analysis-using-Amazon-Review-Data

Predicting a review's numeric rating based on the textual review is a quintessential multiclass text classification problem and an interesting research topic in ```Natural Language Processing```. New advances in NLP including the development of Glove, and Word2Vec, have increased the range of approaches available to address this question, and insights gained on this problem can generalize across sentiment analysis and NLP multiclass classification problems in general. We leveraged the extensive corpus of ```multi-class labeled Amazon data to apply sentiment analysis```.

### Objective:
     Given a text book review, predict one of the three (positive, neutral, negative) sentiment classes.
